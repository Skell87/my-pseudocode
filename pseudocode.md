4. put the lid on the pitcher and press hard to pull out remaining air.
    * if the pitcher overflows, drain a small amount of water then try again.
5. set pitcher in fridge for 8 hours minimum.
6. after 8 hours, you may pour a cup of coffee, ice is optional to keep the drink cold, creamer is optional for added flavor.
    * if the flavor is too weak, let the cold brew refrigerate for a couple hours and check again. when cold brew is at ideal flavor, remove the strainer and discard grounds.
    * strainer with grounds doesnt have to be removed, it will continue to steep for a more robust flavor.
